# some places in Palakkad

Palakkad has always been a special place to me, its my hometown from the age of six. there is more to see in this tiny district of kerala. There are many view points worth trekking all around Palakkad.
two of my favorite mountains are Vamala temple in Palassana and Vizhumala near alathur. The main reason why these two are my favorite because these are the small mountain which will give you the feel of climbing a mountain in just a 5 min walk. To be honest i was never a big fan of climbing mountains and being breathless for seeeing huge chunk of trees and sky, they might be beautiful but i always felt they are never worth the hardship of climbing the mountain,

Vamala is a absolute gem of Palakkad, having a murugan temple situated on the top of the mountain with a tree near it shaped like a heart, its a absolute stunning visual during sun set.

Vizhumala is a boys spot actually, I think Vizhumala is a restricted place, and every time we went trekking there we usually duck under a sign which says "Restricted Area" , but still we will climb that and Vizhumala is interesting because of its phases, it has mainly 3 Phases, the first Phase is the steepest phase according to me and it would definitely test you , but it is nice in the top of first phase, you could see far away cars and busy small cities of Palakkad,
then the second Phase this is a long walk , but you will encounter various towers made with stone it is similar to the old pictures where the pebbles are placed one above the other to make a tower. I actually forgot how it is on top of the second phase, fun fact about me i forget a lot of moments like this , sometime i feel like i was not the person who lived my childhood , i cant even remember 30% of my childhood,
then the last phase, this is just a giant rock on top of the second phase thats all , this is the most tricking of all phases . we have to figure out how exactly we should climb that rock. it is an absolute feeling of fulfillment when you climb all there phases and lie down on the topmost rock , the dreadful part is climbing down , here also the main villain is the first phase the one with the steepiest slopes,
